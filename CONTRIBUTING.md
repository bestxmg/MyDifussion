# ü§ù Contributing to MyDifussion

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Stable Diffusion GPU Learning Project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Basic understanding of Stable Diffusion and PyTorch
- CUDA-compatible GPU (for testing GPU features)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyDifussion.git
   cd MyDifussion
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r docs/requirements_source.txt
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use type hints where appropriate

### File Organization
- **`core/`**: Main application files
- **`utilities/`**: Helper tools and utilities
- **`diagnostics/`**: GPU and system diagnostic tools
- **`experiments/`**: Experimental configurations and tests
- **`docs/`**: Documentation and requirements

### Testing
- Test your changes before submitting
- Ensure the GUI works correctly
- Test on both GPU and CPU if applicable
- Verify memory usage and performance

## üîß Making Changes

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Write clear, focused commits
- Test thoroughly
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for code style changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests

### 4. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
